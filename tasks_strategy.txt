Following practices I'm following to learn react js.

Create tasks. For each tasks there will be separate branches will be there.


After Re-verification of Task's then only it will move to  Dev and another verification then app will move to 'master'.

e.g.  TASK-0001 for  task-1


Following tasks will be updated in  dev staging:

TASK-0001: Write "Winter is Coming" in react-app.

TASK-0002: Remove unnecesarry things in app and add your own content and render some small componant.

TASK-0003: Add Labels Text-boxes Buttons etc., its not mandatory to write in one form only. display it anywhere in one page.
